Information Systems have played an increasingly visible role over the past several years in improving the competitiveness of business. More than just tools for handling repetitive tasks, they're used to guide and advance all of a company's' daily activities. Integrated management software is today very often a key source of significant competitive advantage.

最近这些年里,信息系统在协助提高企业竞争力上扮演着越来越重要的角色。它们不仅仅被用于处理重复性的工作，更重要地，它们被用以指导和提升公司的所有日常事务。集成管理软件往往成为当今企业强大竞争力的重要来源。

The standard response to a need for responsiveness, reliability, and rapidly increasing expectations is to create an organization based on departments with a clear linear structure, integrated around your operating processes. To increase efficiency amongst salespeople, accountants, logistics staff and everyone else you should have a common understanding of your problems.

为获得高效可靠的商业运作及快速响应客户需求的能力,我们往往采用职能划分清晰的部门为单位的组织架构。而要提高诸如销售，财务，物流等各部门员工的效率，就必须使他们对企业运作实践有一个清晰的共识。

For this you need a common language for shared references, policies and communication. An ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system makes the ideal platform for this common reference point.

要做到这一点，我们就需要一个交流共通，信息共享的通用语言。ERP（企业资源规划）系统成为这种协同合作的理想平台。

Open Source software at the service of management
---------------------------------------------------

Risks and integration costs are important barriers to all the advantages you gain from such systems. That's why, today, few small- and medium-sized companies use ERP. In addition, the larger ERP vendors such as SAP, Microsoft and Oracle haven't been able to reconcile the power and comprehensive cover of an ERP system with the simplicity and flexibility wanted by the users. But this is exactly what small and medium enterprises are looking for. 

在您试图通过ERP系统获益的过程中，风险和整合成本是最难以逾越的障碍。这就是当前中小型企业很少实施ERP系统的原因。此外，大的ERP提供商，如SAP、微软、甲骨文还没能寻求到能够全面满足客户简便灵活的需要的有效途径，而这种需求恰恰是中小企业所渴求的。

The development processes of open source software, and the new business models adopted by their developers, provide a new way of resolving such problems of cost and quality for this kind of enterprise software.

开源软件正在崛起，针对开源软件开发人员的新商业模式也在形成，这都为解决企业软件成本和质量方面的问题提供了新的思路。

To make an ERP system fully available to small and medium enterprises, cost reduction is the first priority. Open source software makes it possible to greatly reduce development costs by aggressive reuse of open source software libraries; to eliminate intermediaries (the distributors), with all of their expensive sales overhead; to cut out selling costs by free publication of the software; and to considerably reduce the marketing overhead.

为了让ERP系统完全适应中小企业，降低成本是首要问题。开源软件通过大量重复使用开源软件包，使得开发成本得以大大降低；消除了中间环节（分销商）以及昂贵的销售费用；开源软件允许自由传播，因此不需要支付购买费用；同时极大程度减少了市场营销费用。

Since there is open interaction among thousands of contributors and partners working on the same project, the quality of the resulting software benefits greatly from the scrutiny. And you can't be everything at once: accountant, software developer, salesperson, ISO 9001 quality professional, specialist in agricultural products, expert in the customs and habits of pharmaceutical vendors, just as a start. 

在同一个软件项目上，会有数千名贡献者以及合作者相互交流，软件的质量也由此大大提升。作为一个独立的人，你不可能面面俱到：会计、软件开发人员、销售人员、ISO 9001 质量体系专家、农产品专家、中草药专家，还有许多许多。

Faced with these wide-ranging requirements, what could be better than a world network of partners and contributors? Everyone adds their own contribution according to their professional competence. Throughout this book you'll see that the results exceed any reasonable expectations when such work is well organized.

面对这样广泛的需求，全世界的贡献者和合作者一起组成网络无疑是最好的解决方案，每个人根绝自己的专业特长做出贡献。贯穿本书，你会发现这样的工作都被组织得井井有条，结果超乎你的想象。

But the real challenge of development is to make this solution simple and flexible, as well as complete. And to reach this level of quality you need a leader and co-ordinator who can organize all of these activities. So the development team of Tiny ERP, today called Open ERP, is responsible for most of the organization, synchronization and coherence of the software. 

但是开发过程中真正的挑战是如何使得方案简单灵活，同时保持完整性。为了实现这样的目标，你需要一位领导以及合作者，他能够组织安排开发工作。因此，TinyERP（如今更名为OpenERP）应运而生，负责组织管理、同步控制以及软件升级。

And Open ERP offers great performance in all these areas!

OpenERP在这些领域做出了出色的表现。

The Open ERP Solution OpenERP 的解决方案
-----------------------

Because of its modularity, collaborative developments in Open ERP have been cleanly integrated, enabling any company to choose from a large list of available functions. As with most open source software, accessibility, flexibility, and simplicity are important keywords for development. Experience has shown that there's no need to train users for several months on the system, because they can just download it and use it directly. 

OpenERP高度模块化，因此，OpenERP的协同开发已经被干净利落地集成在一起了。任何企业都可以在功能列表中选出合适的进行应用。同许多开源软件一样，可获取性、灵活性、简便性是开发过程中需要关注的重要特性。经验表明不需要对系统的使用者进行几个月的培训，因为这套系统可以直接下载使用。

So you'll find the modules for all types of needs, allowing your company to build its customized system by simply grouping and configuring the most suitable modules. Hundreds of modules are available. 

因此你会发现，各种各样的模块使得你的企业可以选择最合适的进行组合配置以满足个性化需求。目前已有数百个模块可供使用。

They range from specific modules like the EDI interface for agricultural products, which has been used to interface with Match and Leclerc stores, up to the generic demonstration automation module for ordering sandwiches, which can take care of the eating preference of your staff. 

他们有具体的模块，如农产品用的电子数据交换接口；有通用的演示自动化模块，如预定三明治的模块，照顾到你所有员工的饮食爱好。

The results are quite impressive. Open ERP (once called Tiny ERP when it started out) is management software that is downloaded more than any other in the world, with over 600 downloads per day. It's available today in 18 languages and has a world network of partners and contributors. More than 800 developers participate in the projects on the collaborative development system of Tiny Forge.

应用的效果给人的印象十分深刻。OpenERP（起初被称作TinyERP）的下载量比其他同类软件高出很多，平均每天600次。它如今支持18种语言，拥有全球贡献者和合作者的网络。在Tiny Forge协作开发平台上，800多名开发者参与到这个项目中。

To our knowledge, Open ERP is the only management system which is routinely used not only by big companies but also by very small companies and independent companies. This diversity is an illustration of the software's flexibility: a rather elegant coordination between people's functional expectations of the software and great simplicity in its use. 

据我们所知，OpenERP是唯一能够在大集团公司、独立公司、中小企业甚至微型企业都能正常运转的管理系统。这种多样性体现了软件的灵活性：优雅地兼顾了用户对功能的需求和软件的简洁易用。

And this diversity is also found in the various sectors and trades which use the software, including agricultural products, textiles, public auctions, IT, and trade associations. 

这种多样性还体现在这套软件跨行业跨部门的使用，包括农产品、纺织业、公开拍卖、信息技术产业以及贸易协会。

Lastly, such software has arisen from the blend of high code quality, well-judged architecture and use of free technologies. In fact, you may be surprised (if you're an IT person) to find that the size of Open ERP is less than 4 MB when you've installed the software. We've moved a long way from the days when the only people who could be expected to benefit from ERP were the owners of a widget factory on some remote industrial estate.

最后，该软件通过组合应用高质量的代码、定位准确的开源技术架构，从而提升了整体性能。事实上，你会惊讶于（如果你是一位IT人员的话）OpenERP的安装包只有4MB大小。而且，经过我们的不懈努力，我们的ERP已经不再仅仅为那些偏远地区工业园的生产企业老板们服务了。

Why this book? 本书的目的
===============

Many books set out to tell readers about the management of enterprise, and equally many aim to instruct the reader in the use of a piece of specialized software. We're not aiming to add to those lists because our approach is intended to be different.

许多书想要对读者讲述企业管理，同样，许多书试图指引读者使用一款特定的软件。我们不想再赘述这些问题，因为我们的目标有所不同。

Having restructured and reorganized many businesses, we wanted our management experience to generate a work that is both instructive and practical. It was important for us not to write a manual about Open ERP, but instead a work that deals with advanced management techniques realized through these IT tools. You'll see what management practices might be useful, what's possible, and then how you could achieve that in Open ERP. 

调整和改组许多企业之后，我们希望我们的管理经验能够具有引导性和实用性。因此我们的当务之急不是写一本OpenERP的操作手册，而是通过这些IT工具如何更好地使用先进的管理技术来解决工作中的问题。你将会看到什么样的管理最有效，它的可能性，以及如何通过OpenERP来实现这种高效的管理。

It's this that we'll consider Open ERP for: not as an end in itself but just the tool you use to put an advanced management system into place.

我们对待OpenERP的态度是：并非努力的终点，而是将其视为一个工具，将先进的管理系统实施到位。

Who's it for? 本书的读者
===============

Written by two CEOs who have been successful with new technologies, this book is aimed at directors and managers who have an ambition to improve the performance of their whole company's management team. They're likely already to have significant responsibilities and possess the influence to get things done in their company. 

本书由两位成功使用新技术的CEO所编写，因此，本书的目标读者主要是那些有志改善公司管理绩效的董事以及经理。这些人应该已经在公司中有着举足轻重的地位。

It's likely that most readers will come from small- and medium-sized enterprises (up to a few hundred staff), and independent companies, because of the breadth of functions that need to be analyzed and involved in change. The same principles also apply to larger companies, however.

由于一些功能需要随时分析并进行改动，因此大多数读者应该来自中小企业（最多拥有几百名员工），并且是独立公司。但是，同样的原则也适用于大一些的公司。

Structure of this book 本书的结构
=======================

The first part starts with the installation of Open ERP. If you have already installed Open ERP you can go directly to Chapter 2 to take your first steps on a guided tour. If you're already familiar with Open ERP or Tiny ERP you can use Chapter 3 to find out how to create a new workflow from scratch in an empty database with nothing to distract you. Or you can skip directly to Chapter 4 in Part Two, to start with details of Open ERP's functional modules.

第一部分是介绍OpenERP的安装。如果你已经成功安装了OpenERP，你可以直接去看第2章向导。如果你对OpenERP已经非常熟悉了，你可以通过第3章了解如何在一个空的数据库中创建工作流。你也可以直接跳到第二部分的第4章，凯斯了解OpenERP功能模块的细节。
